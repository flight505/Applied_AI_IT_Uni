Members of the AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset researchers try. *\"If it doesn't work on **MNIST**, it won't work at all\"*, they said. *\"Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others.\"*  \n","Here are some good reasons for using [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist):  \n","- MNIST is too easy. Convolutional nets can achieve 99.7% on MNIST. Classic machine learning algorithms can also achieve 97% easily. Check out our side-by-side benchmark for Fashion-MNIST vs. MNIST, and read \"Most pairs of MNIST digits can be distinguished pretty well by just one pixel.\"\n","- MNIST is overused. In this April 2017 Twitter thread, Google Brain research scientist and deep learning expert Ian Goodfellow calls for people to move away from MNIST.\n","- MNIST can not represent modern CV tasks, as noted in this April 2017 Twitter thread, deep learning expert/Keras author Fran√ßois Chollet.\n","\n","\n","# Task 1:\n","Find Fashion MNIST on the internet and save it as `./input`"],"metadata":{"_uuid":"5dbc8f61ce01988614b8bea0bc878ccc603c32b9","id":"1WV0mfSRo1NC"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Import packages"],"metadata":{"_uuid":"aba7736343f2285046a25c48c0fd5bdd59dc9785","id":"oaNNIwIto1NE"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"source":["# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n","# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n","# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n","\n","import os # processing file path\n","import gzip # unzip the .gz file, not used here\n","import numpy as np # linear algebra\n","import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # data visualization\n","\n","# Input data files are available in the \"./input/\" directory.\n","# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n","\n","from subprocess import check_output\n","print(\"Here are the input datasets: \")\n","\n","\n","print(\"Python Version: \")\n","!python -V\n","# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output."],"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Here are the input datasets: \n","Python Version: \n","Python 3.8.10\n"]}],"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"scrolled":true,"id":"wVrJyvJEo1NE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Load the datasets\n","We haven't use the CSV file because we want to load the dataset using Numpy.  \n","**Notice:** If you use the `mnist_reader.py` codes from  [GitHub repository](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist/blob/master/utils/mnist_reader.py), it might doesn't work.
