Suppose that you are a cardiologist and you want to determine each patient's chance of getting a heart attack based on the body measurments. You have historical data from previous patients that you can use as a training set for logistic regression.  To accomplish this, we're going to build a classification model that estimates the probability of admission based on the exam scores."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9a6ugGMoPkh7"},"source":["Let's start by examining the data."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"H_2gsHb6Pkh8"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","%matplotlib inline"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"tA9fP5AwPkh8"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Tbohn8-5Pkh-"},"source":["\n","## Explore the data a bit.\n","### List:\n","\n","1.
